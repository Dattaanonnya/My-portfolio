                        " A Journey of a thousend miles begind with a single step".Technology plays a huge role in our
                        daily lives, from the simplest of apps to the most groundbreaking inventions. Every website or
                        piece of software that we encounter has been built by a web developerâ€”but what exactly is web
                        development, and what do they do? All of this will be answered in this guide to how to become a
                        web developer.

                        To the outside eye, it can seem like a complicated, confusing, and somewhat inaccessible
                        field.But when we develop and practice without any limits it can seem like a creative and
                        interesting work.
